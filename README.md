# 🏫 Campus SOS DTI B7

> “A transparent, collaborative platform that empowers students to report campus issues — and enables admins to resolve them faster.”

---

## 🎯 Overview

**Campus Problem Mapper** is a web platform designed to **bridge the communication gap** between students and the campus administration.  
Instead of letting issues go unnoticed — broken lights, dirty washrooms, poor WiFi, or unsafe areas — this system brings them to light through a **crowdsourced, map-based reporting tool**.

Students can **drop pins**, describe issues, and even **upvote** problems others face.  
Admins gain **real-time visibility** through an interactive dashboard, making campus management more proactive, transparent, and data-driven.

## 💡 Design Thinking Process

### 1. **Empathize**
Students often notice small campus issues but don’t report them because:
- They don’t know whom to contact.
- They assume it won’t be fixed.
- Reporting processes are cumbersome.

### 2. **Define**
**Problem:** Lack of an accessible, transparent, and motivating system for campus issue reporting.  
**Goal:** Create a **collaborative map-based platform** that makes reporting simple, engaging, and trackable.

### 3. **Ideate**
Brainstormed solutions like:
- Map-based issue pinning.
- Upvotes for validation.
- Gamification via leaderboards.
- Admin heatmaps for insight.

### 4. **Prototype**
A lightweight web app built with **React + Tailwind CSS**, focused on:
- **Clarity** — minimal clicks to report.
- **Empathy** — clear feedback loops.
- **Transparency** — open visibility of reports and statuses.

### 5. **Test & Refine**
User testing focused on:
- Simplifying the map interaction.
- Improving category clarity.
- Adding points/leaderboard to encourage participation.
